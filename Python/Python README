Sample Python Code from senior projects of undergrad. This code creates a GUI and connects to serial communication of XBee radio. 
Also translates XBee HexaDecimal API Frames to readable symbols and characters. 

Getting past the connect screen is impossible without a device and this code will not run fully without an XBee to connect to.
